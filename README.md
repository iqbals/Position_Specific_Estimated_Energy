# Position_Specific_Estimated_Energy
Position Specific Estimated Energy (PSEE) is a residue-wise energy score extracetd from protein sequence only for protein structure prediction.

Quick Run Guide
===============
	
1) SET input
	- Redirect into PSEE/Software/Input
	- Follow the instructions in "ReadMe_Input.txt" to complete "Raw_Data.txt" and "id_list.txt"
	
2) SET path variables within script 'generate_PSEE'
	- Redirect into PSEE/Software/Scripts
	- SET path of PSI-BLAST (BLAST/bin) and NR database
	- SET path of IUPred source codes
	- SET path of libSVM installation directory 
	
3) Run prediction
	- Redirect into PSEE/Software/Scripts	
	- Execute 'generate_PSEE'
		- ./generate_PSEE (SET the permission if required)
	- Prediction outputs will be at "Output/prediction/"
		- 'id.PSEE' 		
		
Thanks!!
ENJOY!!
